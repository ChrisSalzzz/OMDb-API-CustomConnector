# PowerApps REST API-CustomConnector App

## Overview

Welcome to the **REST API-CustomConnector** repository! This project demonstrates how to create a movie tracking application using PowerApps, integrated with OMDb API for accessing a movie database. The app leverages a custom connector to connect PowerApps with OMDb API, providing dynamic movie information and pulling images as well.
