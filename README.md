# PowerApps OpenAI-CustomConnector App

## Overview

Welcome to the **OpenAI-CustomConnector** repository! This project demonstrates how to create a movie tracking application using PowerApps, integrated with OpenAI for accessing a movie database.

## Features

- **Movie Tracking**: Keep track of movies the family has watched, including the ability to log, edit, and delete entries.
- **Movie Details**: View movie posters and detailed information such as synopsis, cast, and ratings.
- **Randomizer Function**: Showcase how to build a randomizer function in PowerApps to suggest who get to choose the movie.
- **Gallery Management**: Demonstrate how to edit and delete items within a gallery in PowerApps.
- **Custom Connector**: A custom-built connector that interfaces with the OpenAI API to fetch movie data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive PowerApp UI designed for ease of use.
